# Data Oriented Markup Language - DOML (.Net)
This is the .net implementation for DOML (Data Oriented Markup Language), which is a 'new' markup language that takes a different approach then most.  It enacts to simulate a call-stack rather than simulate data structures, this allows it to represent a constructor like look rather than the usual bracketed `{...}` mess.

Note: Check out the proper [spec](https://github.com/DOML-DataOrientedMarkupLanguage/DOML-Spec) if you want to see what this language can do and how to use it, for the sake of simplicity I won't repeat myself here.  Furthermore this is 100% compliant with the current spec.
